## General info
[Brown Girls Food Club](https://www.instagram.com/browngirlsfoodclub/) is a newly formed group based in Austin which is building a community of women of color by hosting monthly meetups at minority owned restaurants around Austin. 

As a new organization that is growing far more quickly than anticipated, I recognized the need for a central location for BGFC information, upcoming events, RSVPS and a space for members to connect.

I approached the BGFC group founders with the suggestion and together we identified three important features of the app, with room to grow from there: 
* An interactive page that shows all the restaurants we’ve visited and promotes those restaurants
* An events page where members can RSVP to BGFC events
* A directory where members can connect with others after events.

Checkout a demo of the MVP of our app:

We hope to launch a more polished version of this MVP soon, so stay tuned!
